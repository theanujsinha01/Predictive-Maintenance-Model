# Predictive Maintenance Model ðŸ”§

This application leverages machine learning to predict the **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)** for industrial equipment. Built with **Streamlit**, it provides a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions based on input parameters such as product type, humidity, temperature, age, and quantity.

## Key Features
- **Accurate Predictions**: Predicts MTTF using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Interactive Interface**: Simple and intuitive form-based inputs for users.
- **Real-Time Results**: Instant predictions displayed upon submitting inputs.
